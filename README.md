# SM64 Star- and DeathCounter

This is a little silly Tool I made to teach myself how reading Game-Memory works.
It acts as a combined Death and Starcounter, meaning it will count your Deaths and also the amount of stars you collected.

I got motivated to do this by AndrewSM64 complaining about FramePerfection's Deathcounter Tool not working properly on LunaProject64 and also because I wanted to know how have a local Starcounter to count my Stars during Co-Ops that I've been doing with KingToad74EE and serpals.
